  <li>The word health refers to a state of complete emotional, mental, and physical well-being.</li>
  <li>Healthcare exists to help people stay well in these key areas of life.</li>
  <li>Good health is central to handling stress and living a longer, more active life.</li>
  <li>
    Health can be defined as a holistic way of the growth of the human body and mind. A healthy person’s body is in complete harmony with his mind. We can practice the art of health and wellness by keeping in mind that our bodies are made from living tissues. 
  </li>
  <li>Those tissues require nutrition to grow, and the food we eat is directly responsible for the nutrients that reach our tissues. Keeping that in mind, we must understand the importance of a balanced meal.</li>

  <ul>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
  Most peo>ple infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </ul>
<ul>
  The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
