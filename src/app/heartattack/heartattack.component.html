      <h3>Heart Attack</h3>
      <p> A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, often due to a blood clot. This leads to the death of heart muscle cells, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Prompt medical attention is crucial to prevent serious complications or death.</p>
