  <h1>Corona Virus</h1><br>
  <ul>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals and humans. The most recent coronavirus that has gained global attention is known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19. Here is some brief information about the coronavirus:</ul>

      <p>SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. 
        It quickly spread to other parts of China and subsequently to countries around the world, leading to a global pandemic. 
        The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes.</p>

  Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.

Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the stellar corona, from which their name derives.
