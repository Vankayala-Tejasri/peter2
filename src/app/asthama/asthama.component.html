    <p>Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening
        around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe.</p>
    <p>For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily
        activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.</p>
    <p>Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important
        that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.</p>
    <p>If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any
        other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and
        help keep the condition from getting worse over time.</p>

    <h2>Precautions</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg"

    <ul>
        <li>Dampness and humidity are the prime reasons for triggering respiratory troubles along with decreasing the
            overall vigour and health of the person. Allow sunlight inside the rooms of your home especially the
            bedrooms, open curtains and windows regularly and choose well-ventilated rooms to sleep in.</li>
        <li>Removing dust using a cloth or vacuum cleaner reduces its chances of being flown up and away back into the
            room.</li>
        <li>Objects with an affinity for dust and dander increase the risks of breathing difficulties.</li>
        <Li>Cigarette smoke is probably the most dangerous allergen of all since it triggers many more problems than
            just asthma. A strict no-smoking rule in the house prevents second-hand inhalation.</Li>
        <li>Animals around you though increase the immunity of the person as per the hygiene hypothesis, animal dander,
            on the other hand, is responsible for many respiratory conditions. Avoid pets in your beds too.</li>
        <li>Cold air and low temperatures increase the constriction of airways making it difficult to breathe normally.
            Cover yourself well before going out in the cold.</li>
        <li>Not just in the rain, use an umbrella in the sun too to avoid overheating and triggering a response from
            your sinuses.</li>
        <li>Steam inhalation helps relax the airways and improves mucus release.</li>
        <li>Although intense workouts are not advised as they may trigger the attack, regular relaxing exercises such as
            yoga and walking help improve breathing.</li>
        <li>Asthma is often triggered by emotions and although it is impractical to expect someone to always remain
            happy, spending time with loved ones and engaging in constructive and happy hobbies will help deal with them
            better.</li>

    <h2>Effects of Asthma</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Reduced Exercise Tolerance</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath all are brought on by narrowing bronchi and
        bronchioles due to the tightening of smooth muscles that surround these airways. This is known as
        bronchoconstriction.</p>
    <p>Over time, a lack of activity can lead to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other
        conditions associated with a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
    <h4>Increased Risk of Infection</h4>
    <br>
    <p>With all types of asthma, exposure to irritants inflames your airway tissues, causing an asthma attack. It's your
        body's way of protecting the tissue, but it restricts air passage in and out of the lungs and makes breathing
        difficult. Chest tightness and wheezing are signs of inflammation.</p>
    <p>Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to control inflammation in asthma However, continual inflammation can
        increase the risk of lung infections because it allows infectious material to become trapped in the lungs.</p>
    <h4>Lung Scarring</h4>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg"
        src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-31NzaE3FzXQ/Uoc1GXTQCtI/AAAAAAAABYA/8vgyAitsZwM/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/asthma+disease.jpg">
    <p>Bronchoconstriction and lung inflammation both cause increased production of mucus, which is created by cells in
        the lungs that release chemicals known as cytokines.</p>
    <p>Scarring is irreversible and may lead to permanent lung damage.</p>
    <h3>Airway Remodeling</h3>
    <p>Airway remodeling is a complication associated with all types of asthma severity, and it has been shown to affect
        both large and small airways. Repeated bouts of inflammation and airway constriction damage airways over time
        and lead to structural changes, resulting in progressive loss of lung function.</p>
    <p>The best way to prevent remodeling is to achieve good asthma control. This means having rescue medications
        available when necessary besides your asthma-controller medication.</p>
    <h3>Asthma attack and respiratory failure</h3>
    <p>People with severe asthma also have an increased risk for respiratory failure. Respiratory failure occurs when
        not enough oxygen travels from your lungs to your blood. Life-threatening asthma is rare, but tends to cause
        symptoms that get progressively worse over several days. Ask your doctor more about your treatment options and
        how to manage your condition, if you believe you may have asthma that is life-threatening.</p>

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <h4>Rescue medicine</h4>
    <br>
    <p> A rescue medicine is an inhaler ("puffer") that is used if a person thinks they are having an asthma attack.</p>
    <h4>Controller medicine</h4>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg" src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.d7oVkivaIVt9jneaY-XgNwHaEq&pid=Api&P=0&h=180">
    <p> A controller medicine is a medicine in either a pill or an inhaler taken every day to prevent asthma attacks.
    </p>
    <h4>Common treatment in a hospital</h4>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Oxygen</li>
        <li>Certain drugs that act like an asthma spray, but are much stronger.</li>
        <li>Steroids</li>
        <li>Breathing aids (including tubes, and valves in very severe cases).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>At Home Remedies</h4>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg" src="http://www.healthnormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asthma-Home-Remedies.jpg">
    <h5>1.Garlic</h5>
    <p>Garlic has several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, Because asthma is an inflammatory
        disease, garlic may be able to help relieve your symptoms.</p>
    <h5>2.Ginger</h5>
    <p>Ginger is another herb that contains anti-inflammatory properties and may help with severe asthma. In particular,
        it contains a compound called 6-gingerol.</p>
    <h5>3.Honey</h5>
    <p>Honey is frequently used in cold remedies to help soothe the throat and reduce coughing. You can mix honey with a
        hot beverage like herbal tea to help relieve your symptoms.</p>
    <h5>4.Omega-3 oils</h5>
    <p>Omega-3 oils, which can be found in fish and flax seeds, have been shown to have many health benefits. They are
        also associated with decreased airway inflammation, which may help improve lung function in people with severe
        asthma.</p>
    <h5>5.Caffine</h5>
    <p>Caffeine is a bronchodilator, which means it can help open up the pathways into the lungs. Also, it can help
        reduce respiratory muscle fatigue.</p>
