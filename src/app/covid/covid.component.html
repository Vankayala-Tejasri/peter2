          <h4 class="card-title">Tiredness</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Tiredness is a feeling of weariness or lack of energy. It can be caused by several factors such as lack of sleep, stress, anxiety, depression, and physical activity.
            Fatigue is a feeling of constant tiredness or weakness and can be physical, mental or a combination of both. It can affect anyone, and most adults will experience fatigue at some point in their life.

    Each year, around 1.5 million Australians see their doctor about fatigue. Fatigue is a symptom, not a condition. For many people, fatigue is caused by a combination of lifestyle, social, psychological and general wellbeing issues rather than an underlying medical condition.

          <h4 class="card-title">Fever</h4>
          <p class="card-text">A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person, 
            but it is usually around 98.6 °F (37 °C). 
            A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.
            0-3 months	100.4 F (38 C) or higher taken rectally	Call the doctor, even if your child doesn't have any other signs or symptoms.
            3-6 months	Above 102 F (38.9 C) taken rectally	Call the doctor; he or she may recommend that you bring your child in for an exam.
            Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Cough</h4>
          <p class="card-text">A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It's rarely a sign of anything serious. Most coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don't require any treatment.
            An occasional cough is a normal healthy function of your body. Your throat and airways are equipped with nerves that sense irritants and seek to dispel them. This response is almost instantaneous and very effective.
            Over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are intended to treat the symptoms of coughs and colds, not the underlying disease.
            Prolonged, vigorous coughing can irritate the lungs and cause even more coughing.</p>
