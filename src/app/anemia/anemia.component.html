<p style="text-align:justify"><b>ANEMEIA</b><br><br>
  Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Different types of anemia include: Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Anemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiency.</p>

<br>
<br>



<h2><b>ANEMEIA OCCURS</b></h2><br>
   <div>Anemia occurs when the blood doesn't have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells. This can happen if: The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells. Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced</div>

   <p style="text-align:justify">Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to produce hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that gives blood its red color and enables the red blood cells to carry oxygenated blood throughout your body.</p></div>

   <p style="text-align:justify">What is folate-deficiency anemia? Folate-deficiency anemia is the lack of folic acid in the blood. Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps your body make red blood cells. If you don't have enough red blood cells, you have anemia. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body.</p></div></div>

<h1><b>Types of ANEMEIA</b></h1>
<div style="text-align:justify">As we just mentioned, there are the types of ANAMEIA. However, only four out of these five are considered viable in the present world.</div>

   <div style="text-align:justify">Following are the three types of ANAMEIA worth knowing:</div><br>
<h1>1. Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.</h1>
<div style="text-align:justify">Contents. Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that cannot function properly. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin.</div>
<br>
  <div style="text-align:justify">Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell.</div><br>
  <ol><li> rapid breathing or shortness of breath</li>
     <li> headaches</li>
      <li>indigestion</li>
      <li>feeling weak or tired</li>
      
  </ol><br>
  <h1>2.Hemolytic anemia.</h1><br>
  <div style="text-align:justify">Hemolytic anemia is a blood condition that occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Hemolytic anemia can develop quickly or slowly, and it can be mild or serious..</div>
  <br>
    <div style="text-align:justify">Hemolytic anemia is a disorder in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. The destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.</div><br>
   
   
   <div>Symptoms include:</div><br>
    <ol>
    
        <li>Fatigue</li>
<li>weakness</li>
<li>palness</li>
<li>triedness</li>
<li>chills</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>

    </ol><br>
    <h1>3.Idiopathic aplastic anemia.</h1><br>
  <div style="text-align:justify">Aplastic Anemia (AA) is also known as idiopathic aplastic anemia (IAA) and the production of new blood cells ceases in AA, which leads to an abnormal hematological syndrome such as pancytopenia and suppression of hypo-cellular bone marrow.</div>
