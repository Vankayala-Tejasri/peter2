  <p>Blood pressure is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood inside your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into arteries that carry blood throughout your body.</p>
  <p>Hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg.</p>
  <h3>Causes of Blood pressure</h3>
  <br>
  <ul><li>kidney disease</li>
    <li>diabetes</li>
    <li>long-term kidney infections</li>
    <li>sleep apnoea – where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing</li>
    <li>glomerulonephritis – damage to the tiny fhttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/blood-pressure-measuring-600w-466434518.jpgilters inside the kidneys.</li>
    <li>narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys.</li>
    <li>hormone problems – such as an underactive thyroid, an overactive thyroid, Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, increased levels of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism), and phaeochromocytoma.</li>
