    <p>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other
        parts of the body.These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.Possible signs and symptoms include a
        lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements.While these
        symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes.Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.</p>
    <p>Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of
        physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol.Other factors include certain infections, exposure to
        ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants.In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections
        such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and
        human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a
        cell.Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due
        to inherited genetic defects.Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.It is then
        typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.</p>

    <p>Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large
        number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to
        perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal
        function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. </p>

    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Doctors have identified several ways to reduce your risk of cancer, such as:</p>
    <h5>Stop Smoking</h5>
    <br>
    <p>If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung
        cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future.</p>
    <h5>Avoid excessive sun exposure</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by
        staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen.</p>
    <h5>Eat a healthy diet</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Limit your intake of
        processed meats.</p>
    <h5>Maintain a healthy weight</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through
        a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.</p>
    <h5>Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink</h5>
    <br>
    <p>If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for
        women and up to two drinks a day for men.</p>

            <h5>Sigmoidoscopy:</h5>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A procedure to look inside the rectum and sigmoid (lower) colon for polyps (small areas of bulging tissue), other
        abnormal areas, or cancer. A sigmoidoscope is inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon. A
        sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to
        remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.</p>

    <h5>The following stages are used for colon cancer: </h5>
    <br>
    <h5>stage:0</h5>
    <br>
    <p>In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall. These abnormal cells may
        become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.</p>
    <h5>stage 1:</h5>
    <br>
    <p>In stage I colon cancer, cancer has formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to
        the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) or to the muscle layer of the colon wall.</p>

    <h3>Endometrial Cancer</h3>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg" src="https://www.lifelinecelltech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Endometrial-System-blog.jpg">
    <p>Uterine cancers can be of two types: endometrial cancer (common) and uterine sarcoma (rare). Endometrial cancer
        can often be cured. Uterine sarcoma is often more aggressive and harder to treat. Explore the links on this page
        to learn more about uterine cancer prevention, screening, treatment, statistics, research, and clinical trials.
    </p>
    <h3>prevention:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cigarette smoking is also a protective factor for endometrial cancer; however, there are many known harms of
        smoking that outweigh this benefit. </li>
    <li>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. </li>
    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Endometrial biopsy:</h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube
        through the cervix and into the uterus. The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the
        endometrium and then remove the tissue samples. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for
        cancer cells.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Dilatation and curettage: </h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The cervix is dilated and a curette
        (spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a
        microscope for signs of disease. This procedure is also called a D&C.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Hysteroscopy:</h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and
        cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It
        may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.</p>
    <h3>Stages of Endometrial Cancer </h3>
    <p>The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:</p>
    <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
    <p>In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the
        cancer has spread.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of
                the uterus).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Stage 2:</h4>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg"

    <p>In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.</p>
    <h4>Stage 3:</h4>
    <p>In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is
        divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries,
                and ligaments of the uterus.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the
            uterus).</li>
        <li>Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the
            body, which carries blood away from the heart).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Stage 4:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far
        the cancer has spread.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.</li>
        <li>Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or
            lymph nodes in the groin.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Kidney Cancer</h2>

    <p>Kidney cancer can develop in adults and children. The main types of kidney cancer are renal cell cancer,
        transitional cell cancer, and Wilms tumor. Certain inherited conditions increase the risk of kidney cancer.

        trials.</p>
    <h4>Prevention:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Factors That are Known to Increase the Risk of Cancer.</li>
        <li>Cigarette Smoking and Tobacco Use.</li>
        <li>Infections.</li>
        <li>Radiation.</li>
        <li>Immunosuppressive Medicines After Organ Transplant.</li>
        <li>Factors That May Affect the Risk of Cancer.</li>
        <li>Diet.</li>

        <li>Obesity.</li>
        <li>Diabetes.</li>
        <li>Environmental Risk Factors</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Treatment:</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>partial nephrectomy:</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Also called kidney-sparing or nephron-sparing surgery, the surgeon removes the cancer and a small margin of
        healthy tissue that surrounds it rather than the entire kidney. It can be done as an open procedure, or
        laparoscopically or with robotic assistance.</p>
    <p>Kidney-sparing surgery is a common treatment for small kidney cancers and it may be an option if you have only
        one kidney. When possible, kidney-sparing surgery is generally preferred over a complete nephrectomy to preserve
        kidney function and reduce the risk of later complications, such as kidney disease and the need for dialysis.
    </p>
    <h4>Stages of Kidney Cancer:</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Stage 1:</h5>
    <p>In stage I, the tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found in the kidney only. </p>
    <h5>Stage 2:</h5>
    <img class="img_deg" src="https://www.urolife.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kidney-cancer-treatment-600x312.png">
    <p>In stage II, the tumor is larger than 7 centimeters and is found in the kidney only. </p>
    <h5>Stage 3:</h5>
    <p>the cancer in the kidney is any size, and cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. </p>
    <h5>Stage 4:</h5>
    <p>cancer has spread beyond the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney and may have spread into the adrenal gland
        above the kidney with cancer or to nearby lymph nodes. </p>

    </ul>
    <p>To remove a small section of lung that contains the tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Segmental resection:</h5>
        </li>

    <h4>Small-Cell Lung Cancer Stages </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>>Limited stage:</h5>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s in just one lung and possibly nearby lymph nodes. It hasn’t spread to both lungs or past your lungs.

        <li>
            <h5>Stage 2:</h5>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The disease may have spread to your lymph nodes near your lungs.</p>

        <li>
            <h5>Stage 3:</h5>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It has spread further into your lymph nodes and the middle of your chest.</p>

    <p>Cancer has spread widely around your body. It may have spread to your brain, bones, or liver.</p>

    <h3>Liver Cancer</h3>
    <br>
    <img class="img_deg" src="http://www.activebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/liver-cancer.jpg">
    <p>Liver cancer is cancer that occurs in the liver. The liver is your largest internal organ. It performs several
        critical functions to help your body eliminate waste, absorb nutrients, and heal wounds.

    </p>
    <h4>Prevention:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all:</h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink. For women, this means no more than one drink a day.
        For men, this means no more than two drinks a day.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Maintain a healthy weight:</h4>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain it by choosing a healthy diet and exercising most days of
        the week. If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase the amount of
        exercise you do. Aim to lose weight slowly — 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilograms) each week.
    </p>
    <h4>Treatment:</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Partial hepatectomy : </h5>
    <p>A partial hepatectomy is performed to remove a portion of the liver. This surgery is typically used only for
        early-stage liver cancer.</p>
    <h5>Liver transplant : </h5>
    <p>A liver transplant involves replacing the entire liver with a healthy liver from a suitable donor. A transplant
        may be considered if the cancer hasn’t spread to other organs. </p>
    <h5>Radiation therapy : </h5>
    <p> Radiation therapy uses beams of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells. It can be delivered by external beam
        radiation or by internal radiation. </p>
    <h5>Chemotherapy : </h5>
    <p>Chemotherapy is a powerful form of drug therapy that destroys cancer cells. The medications are typically
        injected intravenously, or through a vein. In most cases, you can receive chemotherapy as an outpatient
        treatment. </p>
    <h5>Immunotherapy : </h5>

    <p>Immunotherapy treats cancer using your body’s own immune system. Treatment with immunotherapy drugs can help your
        body recognize and destroy cancer cells. Like other cancer therapies, serious side effects are possible. </p>
    <h4> Stages of Liver Cancer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>stage 0: very early</li>
        <li>stage A: early</li>
        <li>stage B: immediate</li>
        <li>stage C: advanced</li>
        <li>stage D: end-stage</li>
    </ul>
