      <p>They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing.</p>
      <p>The CDC COVID-19 diagnostic panel is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test. In qRT-PCR, oligonucleotide primers are used to amplify pieces of nucleic acid (ie, RNA or DNA), which can be detected by a fluorescently labeled probe.</p>
      <p>The PCR test takes a sample of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and “amplifies” it with the help of lab technologies.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<p>

                <p>The process for pre-registration for the COVID-19 vaccine is as follows:
                   An online registration link can be used. The link is as follows:
                  <a href="https://hmi.govt.lc/">https://hmi.govt.lc/</a>
                   Individuals who do not have access to the online registration platform can pre-register at the Community Wellness Centre nearest to their place of residence. This can be done</p>
               </div>
              
              
          

            <p>
                To get tested for COVID-19, you need to pre-register online or by phone. Provide your personal details,
                contact information, and any relevant health information required by the testing facility.

            <p>
                Once you've completed the pre-registration, you'll visit the designated testing center at your scheduled
                time. A healthcare professional will collect a sample, usually through a nasal swab or saliva sample.
                This process is quick and relatively painless.
            </p>
            <p>Sterile swabs should be used for the collection of upper respiratory specimens. This is important both to ensure patient safety and preserve specimen integrity. Note that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens are not appropriate for self-collection. Testing lower respiratory tract specimens is also an option.</p>

              <p>Molecular tests

                PCR, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and other molecular amplification tests detect the virus's genetic material. Molecular tests are the most accurate tests for detecting the virus that causes COVID-19. They can be used whether or not you have symptoms.</p>
          </div>
            <p>
                After the sample collection, the collected specimen will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. The
                testing results usually take a day or two to process. You will be notified of your test result via phone,
                email, or a secure online portal. In case of a positive result, follow the guidance provided by healthcare
                professionals and local health authorities to prevent further spread of the virus.
