        <p><b>what is malaria?</b><br><br>
            Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type
            of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking
            chills, and flu-like illness.Malaria is common in tropical areas where it’s hot and humid. In 2020, there
            were 241 million reported cases of malaria throughout the world, with 627,000 deaths due to malaria. The
            majority of these cases occur in Africa and South Asia.</p>

        <br>
        <br>



        <h2><b>Where does malaria occur?</b></h2><br>
        <div> Malaria typically is found in warmer regions of the world — in tropical and subtropical countries. Higher
            temperatures allow the Anopheles mosquito to thrive. Malaria parasites, which grow and develop inside the
            mosquito, need warmth to complete their growth before they are mature enough to be transmitted to humans.

                    <p>The mosquito appears to have two weapons in its arsenal. One is granulocytes. The team found
                        three times as many of these immune cells in the preinfected group than they did in the
                        uninfected group. When granulocytes detect a foreign body in a mosquito's blood, they can either
                        kill it themselves or signal another cell to come do the job.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSljBY7B6P-x-jHvzUFBLGfYtwmNDXpjaEB_w&usqp=CAU"
                        style="width:100%">

                    <p>But granulocytes don't show up to save the day without help, says Rodrigues. Her team suspected
                        that bacteria are also involved in the anti-Plasmodium response because the parasite weakens the
                        walls of the mosquito's gut, and gut bacteria pour into parts of the body that they're not
                        usually found in. That likely triggers more "baby immune cells" to start turning into
                        granulocytes, says vector biologist and co-author Carolina Barillas-Mury, priming the immune
                        system to battle the Plasmodium invaders.</p>

                    <p>To test whether this was the case, the team repeated the experiment but gave the mosquitoes
                        antibiotics that deplete their gut bacteria. This time, the preinfected group did not increase
                        its granulocyte count—and just as many of its members died as did those in the control group.
                        "Preventing the malaria is probably actually an indirect effect of the system preventing the
                        bacteria being in the wrong place," Barillas-Mury says.</p>

            <br>
            <h1><b>Types of malaria</b></h1>
            <div>As we just mentioned, there are five types of Plasmodium parasitic species that cause malaria. However,
                only four out of these five are considered viable in the present world.</div>

            <div>All of these vectors are equally damaging, but P. falciparum and P. vivax impose the worst impacts on
                the body and can even lead to death if proper treatment isn’t administered on time.</div>

            <div>Following are the four types of Malaria parasites worth knowing:</div><br>
            <h1>1. Plasmodium Vivax</h1><br>
            <div>P.vivax is one of the most common parasitic species that cause Malaria fever. It is very prevalent
                across African countries and even in India. Around one-third of Malaria cases reported in India are
                caused by the P.vivax parasite.</div>
            <br>
            <div> The reassuring factor about being infected by the Plasmodium Vivax parasite is that it’s not
                life-threatening. However, it imposes severe symptoms that lead to weakness, compromised immune system,
                and a delayed recovery.</div><br>

                class="pv">
            <div class="relative">Symptoms include:</div>
            <br/>
    
            <ol>
                <li> Fatigue</li>
                <li> Diarrhea</li>
                <li>Bouts of fever</li>
                <li>Chills</li>
                <li>Flu-like symptomsciparum</li>
            </ol><br>
            <h1>2. Plasmodium falciparum</h1><br>
            <div>While Plasmodium vivax is one of the most common types of Malaria fever vectors, P.falciparum is the
                most lethal of the lot. Being infected by this parasite can even lead to malaria-related death due to
                delayed treatment.</div>
            <br>
            <div> This particular parasitic species is the cause behind the most Malaria deaths in the world. The
                prevalence of this species is common in Africa, South America, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its
                prevalence is the highest in African countries at 70%. Around 25% of this parasite species is localized
                in Southeast Asian countries.</div><br>
            <div>Lack of treatment or delayed treatment can even affect the brain and central nervous system, leading to
               
                cognitive impairment due to a condition called “cerebral malaria.”</div><br>

            <br>
            <h1>3. Plasmodium Ovale</h1><br>
            <div>The worst part about getting infected with P.ovale is the recurrence of the malarial infection. After
                the initial manifestation of the symptoms and complete recovery, there are chances that the infection
                could recur later.</div>
            <br>
            <div> This happens since some of the parasites stay back in the liver and stay dormant there. When triggered
                in the future, it can lead to risks of a recurred malarial fever, sometimes with worse symptoms.</div>
            <br>
            <div>Generally, the risk of recurrence is between a few months to 4 years after the initial recovery from
                the fever. When they recur in the body, the parasites directly attack the red blood cells, causing lysis
                of the red blood cells, making the patient sick again.</div><br>

            <h1>4. Plasmodium malariae</h1><br>
            <div>Last and another type of rare type of Malaria worth knowing about is Plasmodium malariae. It is
                prevalent across African, American, and South Asian countries.</div>
            <div> In India, this particular parasite accounts for 1% of the reported malaria cases. It is not a lethal
                or fatal type of malaria and is generally curable with timely treatment. Even the symptoms are quite
                less and limiting with this type of malarial infection.</div><br>
